# As you use Kubernetes you will eventually find yourself in the situation where your pod is in CrashLoopBackoff 
# and you scratching your head on what is going on.
# All you want to do is get a shell to the failed container, 
# so you can troubleshoot why it is failing, but there is no container to connect to!
# No sweat! The first thing to do is change your pod command spec and set it into an infinite loop.
# As specified in the Kubernetes Run a command in a Shell documentation, 
# you can override the command that docker uses to run your container.


# Edit the workload that defines your pod, for example a deployment or replica set

# Now replace that with a command that sets the container in an infinite loop

#     spec:
#       containers:
#       - name: nginx
#         image: nginx:1.14.2
#         command: ["/bin/sh"]
#         args: ["-c", "while true; do echo hello; sleep 10;done"]

#     spec:
#       containers:
#       - name: nginx
#         image: nginx:1.14.2
#         command:
#         - /bin/sh
#         args:
#         - -c
#         - while true; do echo hello; sleep 60;done
